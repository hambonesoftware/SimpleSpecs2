You are given the full text of a technical document.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown fencing, no commentary). Use exactly:
{
  "headers": [
    { "title": "string (exactly as printed in the MAIN BODY; preserve spacing and line breaks if they appear)",
      "level": 1|2|3,
      "page": integer (1-based page number) }
  ]
}

Rules:
- MAIN BODY ONLY — exclude Table of Contents, Index, running headers/footers, and committee/personnel/foreword pages.
- Titles must match the visible heading text exactly. If a heading wraps across lines, normalize whitespace only to join the visual title; otherwise preserve line breaks exactly if present.
- Page is the page where the heading title appears in the MAIN BODY (not the TOC’s page listing).
- Include all top-level headers and their subheaders (levels 1–3).
- No extra keys. Return a single JSON object only.
