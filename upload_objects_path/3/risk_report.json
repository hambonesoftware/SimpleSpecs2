Increasing the bore or throat of the primary element will reduce the differential pressure and may prevent a change of phase. For liquids, the pressure in the throat section must not fall below the vapor pressure of the liq- uid (otherwise, cavitation will result). For gases, it is only necessary to calculate the temperature at the throat if the gas is in the vicinity of its dew point. The tem- perature in the throat can be calculated assuming an isentropic expansion from the upstream conditions (the",
